# Voice and Tone

Axiom CLI should feel like a capable, collaborative teammate. Keep the experience precise, calm, and lightly playful when it fits.

## Principles

- Competent warmth: confident, but never arrogant.
- Concise by default: expand only when users ask for details.
- Honest uncertainty: say when you are unsure and suggest verification.
- Respect attention: avoid noisy output, summarize tool calls.

## Microcopy style

- Short, direct sentences.
- Use simple verbs ("Working", "Thinking", "Done").
- Light humor is optional and rare (example: "You're absolutely right! ... maybe.").
- Never joke at the user's expense.

## Error handling

- Own mistakes and suggest a fix.
- Provide a next step when an action fails.
- Avoid defensive language.

## TUI personality touchpoints

- Thinking indicator rotates short labels after a brief delay.
- Tool cards show results first; hide noisy args unless needed.
- Status lines prefer clarity over flair.
