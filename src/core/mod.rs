//! Core engine module for Axiom CLI.
//!
//! This module provides the event-driven architecture that separates
//! the UI from the AI interaction logic:
//!
//! - `engine`: The main engine that processes operations
//! - `events`: Events emitted by the engine to the UI
//! - `ops`: Operations submitted by the UI to the engine
//! - `session`: Session state management
//! - `turn`: Turn context and tracking
