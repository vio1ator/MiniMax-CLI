# MiniMax CLI

> **Alpha** — Unofficial community project. Not affiliated with MiniMax Inc.

![CI](https://github.com/Hmbown/MiniMax-CLI/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Terminal client for [MiniMax M2.1](https://platform.minimax.io). Chat, agent mode, and native media generation.

**Note:** Currently tested with the standard MiniMax API only. The MiniMax coding-focused plans have not been tested yet.

## What's Unique

MiniMax M2.1 has built-in media generation APIs. This CLI exposes them directly:

```bash
# Generate images
/minimax image "a cat wearing a space helmet"

# Generate music
/minimax music "lo-fi beats, rainy day, piano"

# Text-to-speech with voice cloning
/minimax tts "Hello world" --voice custom_voice

# Generate video clips
/minimax video "drone shot of mountains at sunset"
```

These aren't wrappers around other services - they're native MiniMax capabilities included with your API key.

## Install

```bash
cargo install minimax-cli
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hmbown/MiniMax-CLI
cd MiniMax-CLI
cargo install --path .
```

Prebuilt binaries: [Releases](https://github.com/Hmbown/MiniMax-CLI/releases)

## Usage

```bash
minimax              # Interactive TUI
minimax -p "prompt"  # One-shot mode
minimax --yolo       # Agent mode (shell + file tools)
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.minimax/config.toml`:

```toml
api_key = "your-api-key"
```

Or set `MINIMAX_API_KEY` in your environment.

Get an API key at [platform.minimax.io](https://platform.minimax.io).
