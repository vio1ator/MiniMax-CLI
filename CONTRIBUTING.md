# Contributing to MiniMax CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MiniMax CLI! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85 or later (edition 2024)
- Cargo package manager
- Git

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MiniMax-CLI.git
   cd MiniMax-CLI
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. Run with development settings:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing to ensure consistent formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` and address all warnings
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for types)
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass: `cargo test`
- For integration tests, use the `tests/` directory

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add --doctor command for system diagnostics`
